POW002_Loops_Basic_forloop
Program Description:
	Write a program that repeats a 
	sentence as many times the user wants to.
Algorithm:
1) ask the user to enter the number of times he or she wants to repeat a sentence.
2) Ask the user to enter the sentence to be repeated.
3) Create a for loop to repeat such a sentence:
	-The loop should print the something line:
		1 "This is a sentence."
		2 "This is a sentence."
		3 "This is a sentence."
		4 "This is a sentence."
		5 "This is a sentence."
		...
4) print asterisks for each time the sentence was repeated.
   for example, if you entered the sentence to be repeated 5 times,
   your program should print 5 asterisks ass follow:
   
   *****

5) Repeat step 1 to 4 but now ask the user to enter the number of times 
   followed by the sentence to be repeated.
