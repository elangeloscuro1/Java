POW001_Scanner_inputs
Write a program that asks the user to enter data for the following variables:

String fullName;
int age;
String bookTitle;
double aDecimal;
String word1;
String word2;
String word3;
String word4;

For fullName, age, bookTitle, and aDecimal, echo the user each time each data is entered.
For word1, word2, word3, and word4, let the user entere this data in a single line, and
then display each word in separate print lines.
Note: 
	use quotations marks each time a data is displayed!
